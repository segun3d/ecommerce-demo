# This file contains configuration for Diffblue Cover that is specific for
# this project, typically a custom buildCmd, testCmd, classpathCmd and
# java-version (as a CBMC argument).
#
# Other general options such as skipVerification, ignoreExistingCoverage, CBMC
# arguments (except for java-version) and phases SHOULD NOT be specified here.
# They are part of diffblue.yml file that is automatically generated by
# merging this file on top of a custom yml file using the script
# in dashboard/scripts/update-diffblue-yml. Specifying the options here could
# cause the options to be inconsistent with other benchmarks.
